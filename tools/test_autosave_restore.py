"""Check that every autosave a match writes can be restored, that retention keeps exactly the set a
rejoin can use, and that both peers name the same rewind point.

Three rows, each with the statement that is red without the engine change:

  restore   - a checkpoint the caller names - the OLDEST the match still retains, not the one the store
              would pick by itself - is restored through the Autosaves load path, and the restored world
              is the one that checkpoint recorded.
              RED before the change: no load path reaches Autosaves/ and the archive carries no tick
              identity, so `[autosave] restore_check` cannot be produced at all.
  retention - a match that writes more checkpoints than the policy keeps ends up holding exactly the
              newest restorable ones, under the same file names on both peers.
              RED before the change: the peers name their checkpoints with their own process id and
              wall clock, so the two retained sets share no file name.
  anchor    - a heal that lands after several checkpoints makes the host name one of them and the client
              record that same one; the named checkpoint survives the rotation of the ones that follow.
              RED before the change: no rewind point is named, carried or pinned anywhere.

Ports: this driver owns 48700-48709 and takes three consecutive ports from that block, so it never
overlaps tools/test_autosave.py (48211-48219, 48500-48519), tools/test_post_match_report.py or
tools/test_post_match_combined.py (48215) and can run beside them.

Nothing here widens a comparison: the restored-world statement is the engine's own world-structure
digest against the digest the checkpoint recorded, and the retained set is compared exactly.
